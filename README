The perl program prob.pl wraps RNAfold and RNAplfold from the Vienna package 
to predict accessibility of a target RNA to a hybridizing short oligonucleotide. 
The target RNA might be a mRNA, a viral RNA, or similar; the oligonucleotide 
might be a DNAzyme, a siRNA, or similar.

prob.pl reads a sequence file with an RNA sequence; supported formats are 
FASTA, Vienna, GenBank, and EMBL. It then determines pairing probabilities 
at a given temperature via RNAfold and RNAplfold. Pairing probabilities, 
accessibility, and further information on the RNA are extracted from the 
output of RNAfold and RNAplfold and written in CSV format if the accessible 
regions of the RNA contain a site cleavable by a selected DNAzyme class. 
Furthermore, a GLE script is written that uses the CSV file to create a 
graphical representation of pairing probabilities, accessibility, and 
position of cleavage sites.

For execution, prob.pl needs a locally installed perl, RNAfold and RNAplfold.
